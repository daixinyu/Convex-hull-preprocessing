# Convex-hull-preprocessing
A neural network algorithm using convex hull preprocessing is compared with the traditional neural network algorithm, which can significantly indicate the efficiency of model generation. This can be verified by modifying the number of training times in the code. ConvexHull. py line 204 NeuralNetwork. py line 202.
